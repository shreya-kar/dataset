The provided data pertains to the Shareholders' Relationship Committee (SRCB) of Bandhan Bank as of March 31, 2023. The SRCB, chaired by Mr. Narayan Vasudeo Prabhutendulkar, consists of 75% Independent Directors and 25% Non-Independent Directors, with no representation from Executive or Non-Executive categories. During FY 2022-23, the committee held four meetings, and all members, except for Mr. Ranodeb Roy who did not attend any meetings, maintained a 100% attendance record. The gross sitting fees paid to Independent Directors ranged from ?60,000 to ?2,40,000, while Non-Independent Directors did not receive any sitting fees. The SRCB is responsible for addressing shareholder grievances, reviewing the transfer and transmission of shares, investigating complaints related to share allotments, and monitoring the performance of the Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA). Notably, the committee experienced several changes in membership, with four members ceasing to be part of the SRCB due to the cessation of their directorships and Dr. Aparajita Mitra joining as an Independent Director on May 17, 2023.
Overall Summary:
Bandhan Bank demonstrates a strong commitment to maintaining positive relationships with its shareholders through its dedicated SRCB. The committee's composition, with a majority of Independent Directors, ensures objective and impartial handling of shareholder-related matters. The high attendance record of most members reflects their commitment to fulfilling the committee's responsibilities. However, the absence of one member throughout the year raises concerns about the committee's overall effectiveness. The changes in membership, while driven by the cessation of directorships, highlight the importance of succession planning and ensuring continuity in the committee's operations.
