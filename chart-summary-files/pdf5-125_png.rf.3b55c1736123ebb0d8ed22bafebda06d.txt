Independent Directors received a gross sitting fee of ?60,000, while Executive Directors did not receive any sitting fees. The SCMHVF is responsible for identifying systematic loopholes that facilitate high-value frauds, reviewing the reasons for delays in fraud detection, monitoring the progress of investigations, and ensuring staff accountability.
Overall Summary:
Bandhan Bank demonstrates a proactive approach to mitigating high-value frauds through its dedicated SCMHVF. The committee's composition, with a majority of Independent Directors, ensures objective oversight and independent scrutiny of fraud-related matters. The limited number of meetings held during FY 2022-23, however, raises concerns about the committee's proactive engagement in monitoring and preventing high-value frauds. The committee's focus on identifying systemic loopholes, reviewing delays in detection, and ensuring staff accountability underscores its commitment to strengthening internal controls and safeguarding the bank's interests.
