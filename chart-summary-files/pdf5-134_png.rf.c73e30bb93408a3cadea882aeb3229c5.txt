The provided data from Bandhan Bank, as of March 31, 2023, reveals key insights into its shareholder structure and stock dematerialization. A staggering 96.08% of the bank's shares, equivalent to 1,54,76,29,333 shares, are held in dematerialized form with the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL). This indicates a strong preference for electronic shareholding among investors. Bandhan Financial Holdings Limited emerges as the majority shareholder, holding 39.99% of the total shares, followed by Caladium Investment Pte. Ltd. with 7.78%. Interestingly, while a significant 93.37% of shareholders hold a relatively small number of shares each (1-5,000), they collectively account for only 2.25% of the total shareholding. In contrast, a mere 0.33% of shareholders, each holding over 1,00,001 shares, control a substantial 94.23% of the total shares, highlighting a concentrated ownership structure.
Overall Summary:
Bandhan Bank exhibits a highly dematerialized shareholding pattern, reflecting investor confidence and facilitating efficient trading. The bank's ownership structure reveals a concentration of shares in the hands of a few large institutional investors, primarily Bandhan Financial Holdings Limited. This suggests a strong influence of these entities on the bank's strategic direction. However, the presence of a large number of retail investors, albeit with smaller holdings, indicates broader public trust in the bank's performance.
