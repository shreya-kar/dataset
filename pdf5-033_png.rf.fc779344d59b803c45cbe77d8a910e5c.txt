The provided data showcases Bandhan Bank's financial performance from FY19 to FY23 across six key metrics, all measured in ? crore unless otherwise specified. Deposits have steadily increased from ?43,232 crore in FY19 to ?1,08,069 crore in FY23, indicating strong customer trust and growth in the bank's deposit base. CASA, representing current and savings account deposits, has also shown a consistent upward trend, rising from ?17,618 crore to ?42,455 crore over the same period. This growth in CASA is particularly significant as it reflects a higher proportion of low-cost funds for the bank. However, the CASA ratio, which measures the proportion of CASA deposits to total deposits, has declined from 40.75% in FY19 to 39.29% in FY23, suggesting a faster growth in term deposits compared to CASA. Net worth has steadily increased from ?10,969 crore to ?18,402 crore, reflecting the bank's growing financial strength. Net Total Income, representing the bank's core operating income, has also shown a positive trend, rising from ?5,558 crore to ?11,728 crore. Profit after tax, however, exhibits a fluctuating trend, peaking at ?3,024 crore in FY20, dipping to ?126 crore in FY22, and recovering to ?2,395 crore in FY23.
Overall Summary:
Bandhan Bank has demonstrated robust growth in deposits and CASA, indicating strong customer relationships and a healthy deposit mix. While the CASA ratio has slightly declined, the bank's net worth and net total income have consistently grown, reflecting strong financial performance. The fluctuations in profit after tax, particularly the dip in FY22, warrant further analysis to understand the underlying factors and ensure sustainable profitability. Overall, Bandhan Bank's financial performance highlights its growth trajectory and strong market position within the Indian banking sector.
