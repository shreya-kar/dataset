
The provided data illustrates three key financial ratios for Balrampur Chini Mills Limited from FY19 to FY23: EBITDA margin (%), Gearing (ratio), and Interest cover (times). The EBITDA margin, reflecting the company's operating profitability, shows a declining trend, starting at 15.08% in FY19 and dropping to 10.98% in FY23. This decline is attributed to lower sugar sales volumes, impacting the company's overall operational efficiency. Gearing, a measure of the company's financial leverage, remained relatively stable between FY19 and FY22, fluctuating between 0.18 and 0.34. However, it significantly increased to 0.21 in FY23, primarily due to fresh loans availed for part-financing capital expenditures. This indicates a higher reliance on debt financing. Lastly, the Interest cover ratio, measuring the company's ability to service its interest expenses, shows fluctuations throughout the period. It peaked at 22.67 times in FY22 before declining to 10.53 times in FY23, remaining at a comfortable level despite the decline.
Overall Summary:
Balrampur Chini Mills Limited's financial indicators reveal a decline in operating profitability (EBITDA margin) primarily due to lower sugar sales volumes. While the company maintained a relatively stable financial leverage (Gearing) in the initial years, it increased in FY23 due to increased debt financing for capital expenditures. Despite the decline, the interest coverage ratio remains at a comfortable level, indicating the company's ability to meet its interest obligations. However, the declining profitability trend raises concerns, emphasizing the need for Balrampur Chini Mills Limited to explore strategies to improve operational efficiency and reduce reliance on fluctuating sugar prices to ensure long-term financial sustainability.
