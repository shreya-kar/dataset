All members demonstrated a 100% attendance record, except for Mr. Snehomoy Bhattacharya, who attended 67% of the meetings. The gross sitting fees paid to Independent Directors ranged from ?1,20,000 to ?3,60,000, while Non-Executive Directors did not receive any sitting fees. The NRC's responsibilities include formulating criteria for director qualifications, evaluating the balance of skills and experience required for the Board, and devising a policy on Board diversity. Notably, the committee experienced some changes in membership, with Mr. Bhattacharya joining on June 19, 2022, and two members ceasing to be part of the NRC in May and July 2022 due to the cessation of their directorships.
Overall Summary:
Bandhan Bank emphasizes strong corporate governance practices, as indicated by the NRC's composition of solely Independent Directors and their consistent meeting attendance. The committee's focus on defining director qualifications, evaluating Board composition, and promoting diversity underscores the bank's commitment to maintaining a robust and well-governed board. The changes in NRC membership, while driven by the cessation of directorships, highlight the importance of succession planning and ensuring continuity in board-level committees.
