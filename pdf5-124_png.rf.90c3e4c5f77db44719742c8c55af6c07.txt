The provided data pertains to the Customer Service Committee (CSCB) of Bandhan Bank as of March 31, 2023. The CSCB, chaired by Mr. Narayan Vasudeo Prabhutendulkar, consists of an equal proportion of Independent and Non-Independent Directors (40% each), with one Executive Director. During FY 2022-23, the committee held four meetings. While Independent Directors maintained a 100% attendance record, the Executive Director attended only 50% of the meetings. The gross sitting fees paid to Independent Directors amounted to ?2,40,000, while Executive and Non-Independent Directors did not receive any sitting fees. The CSCB is responsible for formulating a comprehensive customer service policy, monitoring product approval processes, conducting annual depositor satisfaction surveys, and reviewing customer service initiatives. Notably, Mr. Ratan Kumar Kesh and Ms. Divya Krishnan joined the CSCB as Executive and Non-Executive Directors, respectively, on May 17, 2023.
Overall Summary:
Bandhan Bank demonstrates a customer-centric approach through its dedicated CSCB, responsible for shaping and overseeing customer service policies and initiatives. The balanced representation of Independent and Non-Independent Directors ensures diverse perspectives in decision-making. However, the low attendance of the Executive Director raises concerns about the committee's effectiveness and the bank's commitment to customer service at the highest leadership level. The appointment of new members with relevant expertise further strengthens the committee's capacity to address evolving customer needs and expectations.
