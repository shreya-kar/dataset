The lollipop plot illustrates Bosch's water withdrawal from 2017 to 2022, measured in cubic meters (m3), with a projected target for 2025. In 2017, water withdrawal was 510,622 m3, peaking at 657,597 m3 in 2018. This was followed by a decline to 582,386 m3 in 2019 and a further reduction to 477,864 m3 in 2020. Water withdrawal increased again to 546,014 m3 in 2021 before slightly decreasing to 566,283 m3 in 2022. The company aims to reduce water consumption by 25% by 2025, using 2017 as the base year. This translates to a target of approximately 382,967 m3 by 2025, indicated by the downward arrow.
Overall Summary: Bosch's water withdrawal data reveals fluctuating consumption patterns between 2017 and 2022. Despite these fluctuations, the company has set an ambitious target to reduce water consumption by 25% by 2025, compared to 2017 levels. Achieving this goal will require a significant and sustained effort to improve water efficiency across its operations. This commitment to water conservation reflects Bosch's awareness of the increasing global water scarcity and its responsibility towards environmental sustainability. The success of their efforts will depend on implementing effective water-saving technologies and practices across their facilities.
