The lollipop chart depicts Bosch's Profit After Tax (PAT) as a percentage of sales from 2018-19 to 2022-23. In 2018-19, PAT stood at 12.4% of sales. This was followed by a sharp decline to 6.3% in 2019-20. The downward trend continued in 2020-21, with PAT further shrinking to 4.7% of sales. However, 2021-22 witnessed a significant recovery, with PAT reaching 10.0% of sales. Despite this positive development, PAT slightly decreased to 9.2% in 2022-23.
Overall Summary: Bosch's profitability, measured as PAT as a percentage of sales, reveals fluctuating performance between 2018 and 2023. After a significant decline from 2019 to 2021, potentially due to increased costs, reduced sales, or a combination of both, the company achieved a strong recovery in 2021-22. This suggests successful implementation of cost-cutting measures, improved sales performance, or a more favorable market environment. However, the slight dip in 2022-23 indicates potential challenges in maintaining this level of profitability, warranting further analysis of potential cost pressures or market fluctuations.
