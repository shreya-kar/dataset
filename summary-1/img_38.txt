The lollipop chart illustrates Bosch's export figures from 2018-19 to 2022-23, with values expressed in millions of Indian Rupees (INR). In 2018-19, exports amounted to 8,989 million INR. This was followed by a slight decrease to 7,869 million INR in 2019-20. Exports then increased to 8,606 million INR in 2020-21, marking a slight recovery. However, 2021-22 witnessed a substantial jump in exports, reaching 11,907 million INR. This upward trend continued in 2022-23, with exports reaching a record high of 12,371 million INR.
Overall Summary: Bosch's export data reveals a generally positive trend between 2018 and 2023, despite some fluctuations. After a minor dip in 2019-20, potentially influenced by global trade dynamics or company-specific factors, exports rebounded and showed significant growth in 2021-22 and 2022-23. This surge suggests a successful expansion into international markets, increased global demand for Bosch's products, or a combination of both. The consistent rise in export figures highlights Bosch's growing presence in the global market and its contribution to India's overall export performance.
