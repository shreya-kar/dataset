The line graph illustrates the Return on Shareholders' Funds (ROSF) for Blue Star, expressed as a percentage, over a five-year period from the fiscal year 2018-19 to 2022-23. In 2018-19, the ROSF stood at a healthy 21.4%. However, this figure declined over the next two years, reaching 18.6% in 2019-20 and further dropping to 11.6% in 2020-21. This downward trend could be attributed to various factors, including economic slowdowns or company-specific challenges impacting profitability. However, Blue Star witnessed a significant recovery in ROSF in 2021-22, reaching 16.8%. The most dramatic change is observed in 2022-23, with the ROSF surging to 30.7%. This significant increase is marked with an asterisk, accompanied by a note stating that excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of the land parcel at Thane, the ROSF would be 20.3%.
Overall Summary:
Blue Star's ROSF demonstrates a fluctuating trend over the five years, with a notable decline in the two years leading up to 2020-21, potentially due to economic factors or internal challenges. However, the company demonstrated a strong recovery in 2021-22, followed by a substantial ROSF surge in 2022-23. It's crucial to acknowledge that the 2022-23 ROSF is significantly influenced by a one-time gain from an asset sale. Excluding this exceptional income, the ROSF stands at a respectable 20.3%, still indicating improved profitability. Investors would need to consider both the underlying ROSF trend and the impact of the exceptional income to assess the company's future profitability accurately.
