The stacked bar chart depicts the combined solar glass manufacturing capacity of Borosil Renewables Ltd. from CY18 to CY23, measured in Tons Per Day (TPD), with an overall capacity of 1350 TPD, equivalent to approximately 8 Gigawatts (GW). The chart is divided into two sections: India and Germany, representing the company's manufacturing locations. In India, the capacity is distributed across three furnaces. Furnace #1 started with a capacity of 180 TPD in CY18 and remained consistent throughout the years. Furnace #2, added in CY19, contributed 210 TPD, while Furnace #3, also added in CY19, contributed 240 TPD, both remaining consistent until CY23. In Germany, Furnace #1 started operations in CY22 with a capacity of 240 TPD, increased to 350 TPD in CY23, and is projected to reach 550 TPD in the future. A green arrow superimposed on the chart visually represents the overall growth trajectory of the combined capacity.
Overall Summary:
The chart highlights Borosil Renewables Ltd.'s significant expansion in solar glass manufacturing capacity, driven by consistent production in India and substantial growth in Germany. The company's strategic investments in expanding its German facility demonstrate its commitment to meeting the increasing global demand for solar glass. The consistent capacity of the Indian furnaces provides a stable foundation, while the projected growth in Germany indicates a strong future trajectory for Borosil Renewables Ltd. in the solar energy sector. This expansion aligns with the global shift towards renewable energy sources and positions the company as a key player in the solar glass market.
