The chart illustrates the contribution of Bosch's "Business Beyond Mobility" segment to its overall revenue from 2018-19 to 2022-23, categorized into domestic and export sales. The values are presented as percentages. In 2018-19, domestic sales constituted 92% of the segment's revenue, while exports contributed 8%. This pattern remained relatively stable in 2019-20, with domestic sales at 93% and exports at 7%. However, from 2020-21 onwards, a clear shift occurred. Domestic sales increased to 95% in 2020-21 and remained at that level in 2021-22, while exports decreased to 5% in both years. This trend culminated in 2022-23, with domestic sales reaching a dominant 97% and exports shrinking to a mere 3%.
Overall Summary: Bosch's "Business Beyond Mobility" segment demonstrates a striking reliance on domestic sales, which have consistently constituted the vast majority of the segment's revenue. Notably, there's a clear trend of increasing dependence on the domestic market from 2020-21 onwards, with domestic sales rising to 97% and exports plummeting to a minimal 3% in 2022-23. This suggests a strategic focus on the Indian market for this segment, potentially driven by strong domestic demand or challenges in expanding the segment's presence in international markets.
