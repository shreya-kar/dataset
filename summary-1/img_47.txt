The chart displays Bosch's capital expenditure from 2018-19 to 2022-23, represented both in absolute terms (million INR) and as a percentage of sales. In 2018-19, capital expenditure amounted to 2,612 million INR, representing 2.2% of sales. This was followed by a significant spike in 2019-20, reaching 5,597 million INR and 6.3% of sales. However, 2020-21 saw a sharp decline to 2,461 million INR and 2.7% of sales. This downward trend continued in 2021-22, with capital expenditure decreasing further to 2,319 million INR and 2.1% of sales. Finally, in 2022-23, capital expenditure rose again to 5,185 million INR, representing 3.7% of sales.
Overall Summary: Bosch's capital expenditure reveals a fluctuating pattern between 2018 and 2023. The significant peak in 2019-20 suggests a period of substantial investment, potentially in expansion or modernization projects. However, the subsequent decline in 2020-21 and 2021-22 could indicate a period of consolidation or a response to economic uncertainties. The resurgence in capital expenditure in 2022-23, despite remaining below the 2019-20 peak, might signal renewed confidence in future growth prospects and a willingness to invest for future expansion or innovation.
