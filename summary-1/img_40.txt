Overall Summary: Bosch's RoCE, a key indicator of a company's profitability and efficiency in utilizing capital, exhibits a fluctuating yet ultimately positive trend between 2018 and 2023. The sharp decline in 2019-20 suggests potential challenges in efficiently utilizing capital, possibly due to economic downturns or internal strategic decisions.

This positive trajectory reflects positively on Bosch's ability to optimize its capital structure and generate shareholder value.
